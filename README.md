# T5X_translations
The project's primary objective is to replicate the capabilities of T5X, a cutting-edge framework designed for high-performance sequence model tasks, with a specific emphasis on language translation.

T5X is a modular, composable, research-friendly framework for high-performance, configurable, self-service training, evaluation, and inference of sequence models (starting with language) at many scales.

It is essentially a new and improved implementation of the T5 codebase (based on Mesh TensorFlow) in JAX and Flax. To learn more, see the T5X Paper.

Below is a quick start guide for training models with TPUs on Google Cloud. For additional tutorials and background, see the complete documentation.
